It calculates energy usage, cost, voltage, and power based on input values, and stores the data in a log file.

Features

- Simulates random energy consumption (kWh)
- Calculates cost based on consumption
- Displays a warning if usage exceeds a predefined limit
- Logs each measurement with a timestamp to a file
- Allows manual calculation of voltage and power from user input
- Maintains an in-memory history of all measurements

Technologies

- Language: C
- Standard libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`
